<p>Richard Avedon was born on May 15, 1923 in New York City. His mother, Anna Avedon, came from a family of dress manufacturers, and his father, Jacob Israel Avedon, owned a clothing store called the Fifth Avenue of Avedon. Inspired by clothing businesses from his parents, as a boy Avedon took a great interest in fashion, especially enjoying photographing the clothes storewhich owner is his father. At the age of 12, he joined the YMHA Camera Club.<p/>
<br>
<br>
<p>Avedon later described one childhood moment in particular as helping to kindle his interest in fashion photography: One evening my father and I were walking down Fifth Avenue looking at the store windows, he remembered. In front of the Plaza Hotel, I saw a bald man with a camera posing a very beautiful woman against a tree. He lifted his head, adjusted her dress a little bit and took some photographs. Later, I saw the picture in Harper's Bazaar. I didn't understand why he'd taken her against that tree until I got to Paris a few years later: the tree in front of the Plaza had that same peeling bark you see all over the Champs-Elysees. <p/>
<br>
<p>Avedon attended DeWitt Clinton High School in New York City, where one of his classmates and closest friends was the great writer James Baldwin. In addition to his continued interest in fashion and photography, in high school Avedon also developed an affinity for poetry. He and Baldwin served as co-editors of the school's prestigious literary magazine, The Magpie, and during his senior year, in 1941, Avedon was named “Poet Laureate of New York City High Schools.” After high school, Avedon enrolled at Columbia University to study philosophy and poetry. However, he dropped out after only one year to serve in the United States Merchant Marine during World War II. As Mate Second Class of a Photographer , his main duty was taking identification portraits of sailors. Avedon served in the Merchant Marine for two years, from 1942 to 1944.<p/>
